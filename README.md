# crawlCodingArticles
This is used for my part-time-Job. My Job is  finding and uploading proper contents for "Programmers" Company. So I automate finding job with this crawler, and this helps me to make dataSet, to be continued with DeepLearning Process. 


Whoever want to use this code can install the required packages using pip by running the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

And then you can run each "script_brunch.py" and "script_youtube.py" file just click "run" button of your editor.
(script_youtube_py file is required to be with your own Google API KEY)
